libksysguard (4:5.1.0.1-0ubuntu1) vivid; urgency=medium

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * New upstream beta release
  * Move data files to libkf5sysguard5-data

  [ Scarlett Clark ]
  * Add missing processlisthelper files
  * Add not-installed for a file installed to /etc rather than /usr/etc

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Revise build-dependencies to only include direct build dependencies,
    dependencies of build dependencies should be pulled in by the build
    dependencies themselves.
  * Bump rules to new pkg-kde include for kde frameworks 5
    + This is to build the package as any other frameworks 5 based package.
    + Drop the manual path change on the dbus config in the -data.install
      as the new pkg-kde should automatically make config content go to
      /etc making the manual move from /usr/etc to /etc pointless.
    + Drop not-installed as the only filelisted there was the moved /usr/etc/
      file
  * Switch to autopkgtest as test suite and override the build time test.
    - We need a more advanced setup as internally libksysguard will use
      kwindowsystem to identify windows running in the current netwm session,
      which will give unintended results (namely right now kwindowsystem
      crashes) if there is no window manager. So we are running a more
      advanced setup using autopkgtest and openbox.
  * libkf5sysguard5-data breaks and conflicts pre-5.0 ksysguard as the
    dbus processlisthelper.conf previously was in ksysguard.
